## 🚀 Quick Start - Deployment

**New to deployment?** We've got you covered!

1. **Read the Complete Guide**: See `DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md` for detailed, beginner-friendly instructions
2. **Use the Checklist**: Follow `DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md` step-by-step
3. **Deploy for Free**: Everything runs on Firebase's free tier - no credit card needed!

**Quick deployment commands:**
```bash
# 1. Setup Firebase
firebase login
firebase use your-project-id

# 2. Deploy security rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes,storage

# 3. Seed data
npx ts-node scripts/seed-data.ts

# 4. Create admin user
node scripts/create-admin-user.js

# 5. Build and deploy
npm run build
npm run export
firebase deploy
```

Your website will be live at: `https://your-project-id.web.app`

**See `DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md` for complete instructions!**

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Install Firebase Functions dependencies
cd functions
npm install
cd ..
```

### 2. Configure Firebase

1. Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your Firebase configuration
3. Copy `functions/.env.example` to `functions/.env` and fill in your Firebase Admin SDK credentials
4. Update `.firebaserc` with your Firebase project ID

**Important:** The Firebase configuration module (`lib/firebase.ts`) validates all required environment variables before initialization. If any required values are missing:
- **Development mode**: A warning is logged to the console
- **Production mode**: The app will fail fast when Firebase services are accessed
- This prevents silent failures and makes configuration issues immediately apparent

### 3. Set Up Firebase Services

```bash
# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Initialize Firebase (if not already done)
firebase init

# Deploy Firestore rules and indexes
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes

# Verify Firestore security rules
node scripts/verify-firestore-rules.js

# Deploy Storage rules
firebase deploy --only storage
```

### 4. Start Development

#### Option A: Using Firebase Emulators (Recommended)

```bash
# Start Firebase Emulators
npm run emulators

# In another terminal, start Next.js dev server
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 to see your portfolio website.

#### Option B: Using Lightweight Test Server (No Java Required)

For quick API testing without the full Firebase Emulator Suite:

```bash
# Start the test server
cd functions
node test-server.js
```

Visit http://localhost:3001 to access the test server UI with clickable endpoint links.

The test server provides:
- Mock API endpoints matching the production API structure
- In-memory data storage for testing
- Interactive web UI for easy endpoint testing
- No Java or Firebase Emulator dependencies required
- Gradient placeholder support for projects with empty thumbnails (matches production behavior)

## API Endpoints

The portfolio website exposes RESTful API endpoints via Firebase Functions for accessing portfolio data.

### Authentication Middleware

The portfolio website uses Firebase Authentication to protect admin endpoints. The authentication middleware (`functions/src/middleware/auth.ts`) provides reusable functions for verifying Bearer tokens.

**Key Features:**
- Extracts and verifies Firebase Auth tokens from Authorization headers
- Returns 401 Unauthorized for missing or invalid tokens
- Provides decoded user information to authenticated endpoints
- Consistent error response format across all protected endpoints

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
import { requireAuth } from '../middleware/auth';

export const myAdminEndpoint = functions.https.onRequest(async (req, res) => {
  // Verify authentication
  const user = await requireAuth(req, res);
  if (!user) return; // Response already sent by middleware
  
  // Continue with authenticated logic
  // user contains decoded token with uid, email, etc.
});
```

**Authentication Flow:**
1. Client includes Bearer token in Authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
2. Middleware extracts token and verifies with Firebase Admin SDK
3. If valid, decoded token is returned to the endpoint handler
4. If invalid/missing, middleware sends 401 response and returns null

All admin endpoints (create/update/delete projects, image upload) use this middleware for consistent authentication enforcement.

### Available Endpoints

**Projects API** (`functions/src/api/projects.ts`)

- **GET /api/v1/projects** - Retrieves all published projects
  - Returns projects ordered by creation date (newest first)
  - Implements CORS headers for cross-origin requests
  - Response: `{ projects: Project[] }`
  - Status codes: 200 (success), 405 (method not allowed), 500 (server error)

- **GET /api/v1/projects/:id** - Retrieves a single project by ID
  - Returns 404 if project doesn't exist or is not published
  - Response: `{ project: Project }`
  - Status codes: 200 (success), 400 (invalid ID), 404 (not found), 405 (method not allowed), 500 (server error)

All API endpoints:
- Return JSON responses with consistent error format
- Include proper HTTP status codes
- Support CORS for cross-origin requests
- Handle OPTIONS preflight requests
- Convert Firestore Timestamps to ISO 8601 strings

### Error Response Format

```json
{
  "error": "Human-readable error message",
  "code": "MACHINE_READABLE_CODE",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Firebase Configuration

The `lib/firebase.ts` module handles Firebase initialization with graceful error handling:

**Key Features:**
- **Validation**: Checks all required Firebase configuration values before initialization
- **Graceful Degradation**: Prevents build failures when environment variables are missing
- **Development Warnings**: Logs helpful warnings in development mode for missing configuration
- **Service Initialization**: Exports initialized Auth, Firestore, and Storage services

**Configuration Validation:**
The module validates that all required Firebase configuration values are present before attempting initialization:
- API Key
- Auth Domain
- Project ID
- Storage Bucket
- Messaging Sender ID
- App ID

**Error Handling:**
- In development: Logs a warning if configuration is incomplete
- In production: Creates placeholder values that will throw errors if used (intentional fail-fast behavior)
- Prevents import errors while ensuring configuration issues are caught early

**Usage:**
```typescript
import { auth, db, storage } from '@/lib/firebase';

// Services are ready to use if configuration is valid
const user = await auth.currentUser;
const projects = await db.collection('projects').get();
```

**Environment Variables:**
All Firebase configuration is loaded from environment variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` for client-side access. See the Environment Variables section below for the complete list.

## Data Access Layer

The `lib/firestore.ts` module provides a typed data access layer for Firestore operations:

### Available Functions

- **fetchAllProjects()** - Retrieves all published projects, ordered by creation date
- **fetchProjectById(projectId)** - Retrieves a single project by ID (returns null if not found or unpublished)
- **fetchProfile()** - Retrieves the portfolio owner's profile information
- **createInquiry(formData, ip)** - Creates a new inquiry from contact form submissions

All functions include proper error handling, type safety, and automatic timestamp conversion from Firestore Timestamps to JavaScript Dates.

### Custom Hooks

The `lib/hooks/` directory provides React hooks for data fetching with intelligent caching:

**useCachedProjects** (`lib/hooks/useCachedProjects.ts`)
- Fetches and caches all published projects using SWR
- 30-minute cache TTL to minimize Firestore reads
- 60-second deduplication to prevent duplicate requests
- Automatic revalidation on network reconnect
- Helps stay within Firebase free-tier limits (50,000 reads/day)

```typescript
import { useCachedProjects } from '@/lib/hooks/useCachedProjects';

function ProjectsList() {
  const { data: projects, error, isLoading } = useCachedProjects();
  
  if (isLoading) return <LoadingSpinner />;
  if (error) return <ErrorMessage />;
  
  return projects.map(project => <ProjectCard key={project.id} project={project} />);
}
```

**useAuth** (`lib/hooks/useAuth.ts`)
- Manages Firebase Authentication state
- Provides current user and loading state
- Handles sign in/out operations

**useProfile** (`lib/hooks/useProfile.ts`)
- Fetches and caches portfolio owner profile data
- Similar caching strategy to useCachedProjects

### Testing Coverage

The data access layer is validated through comprehensive property-based tests in `lib/__tests__/firestore.pbt.test.ts`:
- Published projects visibility filtering (Property 4)
- Valid inquiry persistence with metadata (Property 10)
- Edge cases and boundary conditions
- Type safety and data integrity

## Type System

The project uses TypeScript for type safety across frontend and backend. All shared types are defined in `types/index.ts`:

### Core Data Models

- **Project** - Portfolio project with metadata, images, and links
- **Inquiry** - Contact form submission with sender information
- **Profile** - Portfolio owner's profile information (includes optional work experience)
- **Experience** - Work experience entry with company, position, location, and date range
- **ContactFormData** - Contact form input data

### API Response Types

- **APIResponse<T>** - Generic API response wrapper
- **ErrorResponse** - Consistent error response structure
- **SuccessResponse<T>** - Successful operation response
- **FailedResponse** - Failed operation response
- **ApiResult<T>** - Union type for success or failure responses
- **PaginatedResponse<T>** - Paginated data response

### Utility Types

- **ExtractData<T>** - Extracts data type from APIResponse
- **PartialExcept<T, K>** - Makes all fields optional except specified keys
- **ProjectInput** - Project creation type (omits auto-generated fields)
- **ProjectUpdate** - Project update type (all fields optional except id)
- **InquiryInput** - Inquiry creation type (omits auto-generated fields)
- **Experience** - Work experience entry for profile (company, position, location, dates, responsibilities)

## UI Components

### Home Page

The Home page (`app/page.tsx`) is a server-side rendered landing page that showcases the portfolio owner's profile and featured projects.

**Key Features:**
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Fetches profile and project data at build time

### Projects Page

The Projects page (`app/projects/page.tsx`) displays all published projects with filtering and search capabilities using a hybrid Server/Client Component architecture.

**Architecture:**
- **Server Component** (`page.tsx`): Fetches data at build time with ISR, relies on root layout from `app/layout.tsx`
- **Client Component** (`ProjectsClient.tsx`): Handles interactive filtering and search

**Key Features:**
- **Page Header**: Prominent title and descriptive subtitle introducing the projects section
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: Regenerates every 30 minutes (1800 seconds)
- **Category Filtering**: Filter projects by category with button controls
- **Search Functionality**: Search by title, description, or technology tags
- **Project Count Display**: Shows number of filtered results
- **Clear Filters**: One-click reset of all filters
- **SEO Optimization**: Static meta tags for search engines
- **Responsive Grid**: 1 column mobile, 2 columns tablet, 3 columns desktop
- **Layout Integration**: Uses Next.js 14 app directory layout system (no explicit Layout wrapper needed)

**Server Component (`page.tsx`):**
```typescript
// Fetches all published projects and extracts categories
const projects = await fetchAllProjects();
const categories = extractCategories(projects);

// Passes data to client component for interactivity
return <ProjectsClient projects={projects} categories={categories} />;

// ISR configuration: revalidate every 1800 seconds (30 minutes)
export const revalidate = 1800;
```

**Client Component (`ProjectsClient.tsx`):**
```typescript
interface ProjectsClientProps {
  projects: Project[];
  categories: string[];
}

// Manages filter state and search query
const [selectedCategory, setSelectedCategory] = useState<string>('all');
const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState<string>('');

// Filters projects using useMemo for performance
const filteredProjects = useMemo(() => {
  // Apply category and search filters
}, [projects, selectedCategory, searchQuery]);
```

## Testing

This project uses Jest for unit testing and fast-check for property-based testing.

### Test Configuration

The project uses separate test configurations for frontend and backend:

- **Frontend tests** (Jest): Located in `app/`, `components/`, and `lib/` directories
  - Configuration: `jest.config.js` (Next.js integration with jsdom environment)
  - Test files: `*.test.ts`, `*.test.tsx`
  - Excludes: `/functions/` directory
  - Coverage collection: Enabled for all source files in `app/`, `components/`, and `lib/`
  - Coverage thresholds: Set to 0% (incremental development approach - tests added as needed)
  - **Component Tests**: Admin login page tests validate authentication error handling (Requirements 12.2)

- **Backend tests** (Jest): Located in `functions/src/__tests__/` directory
  - Configuration: `functions/jest.config.js` (Node.js environment)
  - Test files: `*.test.ts`, `*.pbt.test.ts`
  - Includes property-based tests with fast-check

This separation ensures proper test environments and prevents conflicts between frontend (jsdom) and backend (node) test requirements.

**Test Philosophy:**
The project follows an incremental testing approach where:
- Core business logic and data access layers have comprehensive test coverage
- Property-based tests validate universal correctness properties
- Component tests are added as needed based on complexity and risk
- Admin interface components include error handling tests for user feedback validation
- Coverage thresholds are intentionally set to 0 to allow flexible, incremental test development

### API Testing

#### Lightweight Test Server

For quick API endpoint testing without Firebase Emulator dependencies:

```bash
cd functions
node test-server.js
```

The test server (`functions/test-server.js`) provides:
- **Mock API endpoints** at http://localhost:3001
- **Interactive web UI** with clickable links to test each endpoint
- **In-memory data storage** for testing inquiries and rate limiting
- **No external dependencies** - runs with just Express and CORS
- **Mock data** matching the production data structure

Available test endpoints:
- `GET /api/v1/projects` - Returns all mock projects
- `GET /api/v1/projects/:id` - Returns a specific project
- `GET /api/v1/profile` - Returns mock profile data
- `POST /api/v1/contact` - Accepts contact form submissions with validation

This is ideal for:
- Quick API testing during development
- Testing without Java (required by Firebase Emulator)
- Frontend integration testing
- Validating API contracts

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all frontend tests (excludes functions/)
npm run test:run

# Run with coverage (frontend only)
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode (frontend only)
npm test

# Run backend tests (Firebase Functions)
cd functions
npm run test:run
```

**Note:** The root-level test commands focus on frontend code (`app/`, `components/`, `lib/`) and exclude the `functions/` directory. Backend tests for Firebase Functions have their own test suite with a separate Jest configuration optimized for Node.js.

### Property-Based Testing

The project implements property-based tests (PBT) using fast-check to verify universal correctness properties across the codebase. These tests validate that the system maintains its invariants across a wide range of generated inputs.

**Current Property Tests:**

1. **Property 4: Published Projects Visibility** (`lib/__tests__/firestore.pbt.test.ts`)
   - Validates that `fetchAllProjects()` returns only projects with `published=true`
   - Tests filtering logic with 100+ iterations of randomly generated project data
   - Verifies ordering by creation date (descending)
   - Includes edge cases: all published, none published
   - **Validates Requirements:** 2.1
   - **Status:** ✅ Implemented

2. **Property 10: Valid Inquiry Persistence** (`lib/__tests__/firestore.pbt.test.ts`)
   - Validates that `createInquiry()` persists all submitted fields correctly
   - Tests with 100+ iterations of randomly generated contact form data
   - Verifies auto-generated fields (timestamp, ID, read/replied status)
   - Includes edge cases: minimal input, maximum length input, multiple submissions from same IP
   - **Validates Requirements:** 4.2, 4.8
   - **Status:** ✅ Implemented

3. **Property 30: Image Upload Acceptance** (`functions/src/__tests__/admin.pbt.test.ts`)
   - Validates that `uploadImage()` accepts all valid image files (JPEG, PNG, WebP) under 5MB
   - Tests with 100+ iterations of randomly generated file types, sizes, and names
   - Verifies file type validation (rejects invalid MIME types)
   - Verifies file size validation (rejects files over 5MB)
   - Verifies storage URL generation and folder validation
   - Includes edge cases: exactly 5MB files, 1-byte files, invalid folders, URL uniqueness
   - **Validates Requirements:** 11.3
   - **Status:** ✅ Implemented

4. **Property 32: Draft Visibility Control** (`lib/__tests__/firestore.pbt.test.ts`)
   - Validates that projects with `published=false` (drafts) do NOT appear in public project queries
   - Tests with 100+ iterations of randomly generated projects with mixed published states
   - Verifies draft projects are completely excluded from public results
   - Verifies only published projects are returned regardless of featured status
   - Includes edge cases: all drafts, mixed published/draft, draft state transitions, featured drafts
   - Tests the admin workflow where portfolio owners can save drafts before publishing
   - **Validates Requirements:** 11.5
   - **Status:** ✅ Implemented

**Testing Approach:**

Property-based tests use simulation functions to test business logic without requiring live Firestore connections. This approach:
- Enables fast test execution (no network I/O)
- Provides deterministic results
- Tests the core filtering and persistence logic
- Validates type safety and data integrity

The tests generate random valid inputs using fast-check arbitraries and verify that the system maintains correctness properties across all generated cases.

**Test Structure:**

Each property test includes:
- **Arbitrary generators**: Define the input space (e.g., valid projects, contact forms, IP addresses)
- **Simulation functions**: Replicate the core business logic being tested
- **Property assertions**: Verify invariants hold across all generated inputs
- **Edge case tests**: Validate boundary conditions and special scenarios

**Running Property-Based Tests:**

```bash
# Run all tests including PBT
npm run test:run

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run in watch mode
npm test
```

The property-based tests run 100 iterations by default (50 for edge cases) to ensure comprehensive coverage of the input space.

### Admin User Creation

The project includes a script to create admin users for accessing the admin interface:

**Create Admin User**
```bash
# For Firebase Emulator (local development)
USE_EMULATOR=true node scripts/create-admin-user.js

# For production Firebase (requires serviceAccountKey.json)
node scripts/create-admin-user.js

# Custom credentials
ADMIN_EMAIL=your@email.com ADMIN_PASSWORD=yourpassword node scripts/create-admin-user.js
```

**Default Credentials:**
- Email: `admin@test.com`
- Password: `admin123456`

**Features:**
- Works with both Firebase Emulator and production Firebase
- Automatically detects if user already exists and updates password
- Creates user with email verification enabled
- Provides clear success/error messages
- Supports custom credentials via environment variables

**Usage Flow:**
1. Start Firebase Emulator: `npm run emulators`
2. Create admin user: `USE_EMULATOR=true node scripts/create-admin-user.js`
3. Navigate to admin login: http://localhost:3000/admin/login
4. Sign in with the created credentials

For production Firebase, download your service account key from Firebase Console (Project Settings → Service Accounts) and save it as `serviceAccountKey.json` in the project root.

### Verification and Validation

The project includes utility scripts to verify configuration and security:

**Setup Verification**
```bash
node scripts/verify-setup.js
```
Checks that all required files and directories are present.

**Firestore Security Rules Validation**
```bash
node scripts/verify-firestore-rules.js
```
Validates Firestore security rules for:
- Correct syntax and structure
- Projects collection rules (public read for published, auth required for write)
- Inquiries collection rules (auth required for read, public create)
- Profile collection rules (public read, auth required for write)

## Configuration

### Next.js Configuration (next.config.js)

The project uses a minimal Next.js configuration focused on performance and simplicity:

**React Strict Mode**: Enabled for development warnings and best practices enforcement

**Cache Headers**:
- Static assets (CSS, JS, images) cached for 1 year with immutable flag
- Improves performance by reducing redundant downloads
- Applies to all static file types: jpg, jpeg, gif, png, svg, webp, js, css

**Design Philosophy**: 
- Profile images are served from the public folder (no external domain configuration needed)
- Project cards use gradient placeholders for consistent visual design
- No external image dependencies eliminates configuration complexity
- Provides instant visual feedback without network requests

**What's NOT Configured**:
- No `images.remotePatterns` - profile images served locally from public folder
- No image format optimization settings - using native browser support
- Minimal configuration reduces maintenance overhead
