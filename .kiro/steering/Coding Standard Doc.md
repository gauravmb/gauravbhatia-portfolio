# Code Documentation Standards

## File-Level Documentation
Every source file must include a header comment block that explains:
- The purpose and responsibility of the file
- Key exports or main functionality provided
- Any important dependencies or relationships to other modules

## Inline Documentation
Code should be self-documenting through clear naming, but add comments when:
- The logic is complex or non-obvious
- Business rules or domain knowledge is being implemented
- Performance optimizations or workarounds are used
- Edge cases or special conditions are being handled

## Comment Guidelines
- Write comments that explain WHY, not WHAT (the code shows what)
- Keep comments concise and focused
- Update comments when code changes
- Avoid redundant comments that simply restate the code
